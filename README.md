# SurvivalUI
Creates a GUI for the Survival Profession in TurtleWoW

The default UI uses the vanilla tradeskill UI and has problems loading it's recipes. This addon will give it a unique UI based off assets from the Archeology frame from retail WoW.

It's commands are:
* /svui reset
* /svui scale 
  * The scale is multiplied. For example, a 150% scale would be /svui scale 1.5

It looks like this:

If you don't have the materials to make a Fishing Boat, Dim Torch or Traveler's Tent, they will be grayed out and unclickable.

I've also added custom tooltips to make the fishing boat and tent's benefits more obvious
