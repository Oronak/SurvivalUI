# SurvivalUI
Creates a GUI for the Survival Profession in TurtleWoW

The default UI uses the vanilla tradeskill UI and has problems loading it's recipes. This addon will give it a unique UI based off assets from the Archeology frame from retail WoW.

It's commands are:
* /svui reset
* /svui scale 
  * The scale is multiplied. For example, a 150% scale would be /svui scale 1.5

It looks like this:

You can rearrange this order by clicking the lock icon next to the close icon on the top right

If you don't have the materials to make anything, they will be grayed out and unclickable.

I've also added custom tooltips to make the fishing boat and tent's benefits more obvious
